responsible manner.

Please report any security vulnerabilities by sending an email to

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report, commence an
investigation, and work on a fix.

### Response Timeline:

-   Within 1-2 days: Acknowledge the report.
-   Within 7-10 days: Confirm the vulnerability and determine its impact.
-   Within 14-30 days: Patch the vulnerability, release an update, and publish a security advisory if necessary.

Please refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have addressed it.

Thank you for helping to keep our project and its users safe.
